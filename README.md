## Hi, I'm Anastasiya :blush:

I'm a computer science student trying to learn as much as possible and seeing where it takes me!

### I'm currently...

:ledger: **enrolled in:** nothing! It's summer break!

:telescope: **working on:** making repos for all final projects from the '24-'25 school year

:seedling: **learning:** Git and GitHub, and going through all the [GitHub skills](https://skills.github.com/)  

:tulip: :tulip: :tulip:

Thanks for visiting! :wave:
